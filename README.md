## About
Kakao is the most popular messaging app from South Korea.
They provide Kakao app for PC and Mobile devices. I tried to clone their app design and add messaging feature in the backend with socket.io and express modules from scratch. Clone here does **NOT** mean cloning codes, it means cloning the UI design by looking at the app from the mobile phone screen.
